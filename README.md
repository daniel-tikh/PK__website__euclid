PRACTICAL WORK: LANDING PAGE OF A PRODUCTION COMPANY

This website was created as part of the online course "Frontend Developer PRO", which I took on the basis of the online professional education platform Skillbox to improve my skills and structure my knowledge.

It was a practical work of the module "Adaptability and cross-browserability of the site". Problem statement: to realize a site with accessibility, to fix in practice to ensure crossbrowserability of the site and to build a fully adaptive site on a ready-made graphic template (<a href="//www.figma.com/file/ZckZUKF31dkAYWQQWufZtq/%D0%95%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B4-(new)?type=design&node-id=406480-4006&mode=design&t=iqSxDTnFX6GcD8EE-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">figma layout</a> + UI/UX elements), applying the theoretical material of the training module in practice + PerfectPixel.
